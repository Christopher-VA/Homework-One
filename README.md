## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Review

```
Using what I have learnt I have made the html neater with semantic HTML elements so that when 
inspecting the page you can see the seperation between the Heading, main and footer elements
of the page.

I have also fixed up the link between the heading atribute to link with the alt so that
when its clicked on it will take you to the page element.

I have also done some text on the CSS so that when looked at you get an idea of what each CSS
styling does for those classes/elements.
